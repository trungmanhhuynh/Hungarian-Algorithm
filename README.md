# Hungarian-Algorithm

1.Description: This is an C++ implementation of Hungarian Algorithm for Matching Assignment Problem. The materials of this problem can be found in these following links: 
   - http://www.hungarianalgorithm.com/hungarianalgorithm.php (well design online solver) 
   - http://www.math.harvard.edu/archive/20_spring_05/handouts/assignment_overheads.pdf (well-explanation of the algorithm)
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm (steps to implement and algorithm to find minimum lines) 

2. Lib: 
   - OpenCV 3.1.0 (it may work with previous versions since I only using Matrix operations in OpenCV)
   - cmake 2.7.0
3. Enviroment: CentOS 7.0 (I may work with other linux versions)

4. How to build 
   - mkdir build 
   - cd build 
   - cmake ../
   - make 
5. How to run 
   - ./main 
6. Note: 
   You may able to change your cost matrix in main.cpp.
